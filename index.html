        <p><strong>1. Bears Have an Incredible Sense of Smell</strong></p>
           <p>Bears have one of the best senses of smell in the animal kingdom. A polar bear, for example, can detect a seal's scent from up to 20 miles (32 kilometers) away, even if the seal is buried under 3 feet (1 meter) of snow!
              This powerful sense of smell helps them locate food, mates, and avoid danger.</p>

           <p><strong>2. Bears Are Surprisingly Fast</strong></p>
           <p>Despite their large size, bears are incredibly fast runners. A grizzly bear can reach speeds of up to 35 mph (56 km/h)—faster than Usain Bolt, the world's fastest human!Black bears are also speedy, clocking in at around 30 mph (48 km/h).</p>
        
           <p><strong>4. Bears Hibernate, But It’s Not True Sleep</strong></p>
           <p>During hibernation, a bear's heart rate drops from about 40-50 beats per minute to just 8-10 beats per minute.
              Unlike other hibernating animals, bears do not eat, drink, urinate, or defecate during this period, which can last up to 7 months.
              Female bears even give birth and nurse their cubs while hibernating!</p>
